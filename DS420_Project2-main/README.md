Important:
* Project 1 files are in the "project1" directory
* Notebooks for developing ensemble models are in the "ensemble_notebooks" directory
* Notebooks and py files for comparing project 2 ensemble models are in the "ensemble_comparison" directory
* DNN-related files are in the "DNN_files" directory
* Final comparison notebook (compares all models from projects 1 and 2) is named "creditcard_final_comparison.ipynb"
